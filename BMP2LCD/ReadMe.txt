- At first, run intro_screen.bat to convert your 128x64 pixel intro.bmp picture to intro.lcd

- Load intro.lcd with LCD1.exe and press "8051" button to output the picture in hex format (intro.asm).
If you cannot see the command buttons on LCD1.exe you should resize the window of the program.

- Open the produced file intro.asm and convert it as you need. For example, open it with any text editor (notepad.exe) and replace all "DB " text with commas ",". You can use the command "replace all".
